# Parallex-Website
Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling. Click on the links below to see the difference between a website with and without parallax scrolling.
Parallax scrolling can improve the browsing experience of a website by making it more dynamic and immersive. In the simplest of terms, parallax scrolling is a three-dimensional effect for adding more depth to a webpage. 
In movies we have scene car is moving and behind that building are moving slowly and sunsets are examples of parallax effect.
In this project all design and images were provided by UI/UX designer.
